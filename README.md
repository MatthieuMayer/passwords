# passwords
Create and manage safe passwords for various online accounts.

#### WARNING : before anything, this project is a purpose for me to train and build my Python skills. It theoretically could but SHOULD NOT be used as-is, since the described password creation process is very basic and entirely accessible to anyone.

I imagined this project as a way to improve managing an always growing number of passwords that connected people need to log on the many websites, apps and services they could need/use. I aim for this code to answer three goals :
1. create a unique password for each account (stop using a single identical password everywhere) ;
2. build complex passwords than can be rebuilt anytime the user needs it, but not be saved or written anywhere ;
3. use the code as a command-line tool in a shell.

Again, this code has to be seen as an example/idea/inspiration from which one can imagine A DIFFERENT password creation process.
