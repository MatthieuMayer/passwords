# passwords
Create passwords for online login.

#### WARNING : before anything, this project is a purpose for me to train and build my Python skills. It theoretically could but SHOULD NOT be used as-is, since the described password creation process is very basic and entirely accessible to anyone.

I imagined this project as a way to improve managing an always growing number of passwords that connected people need to log on the many websites, apps and services they could need/use.
I aim for this code to answer three goals :

1. increase security by creating unique passwords for each log in (stop using a single identical password every time) ;
2. build complex passwords than can be rebuilt anytime but not be saved or written anywhere ;
3. use the code as a command-line tool in a shell.

Again, this code has to be seen as an example/idea from which can be imagined A DIFFERENT password creation process.
